Simple TODO application.
------------------------------------------------------------
This is my first application using backbone.
The application is developed using the AMD approch
as making the javascript application modular.

This applications uses the following libraries:
* Backbone
  * BackboneRelational
  * Backbone.localStorage
* Underscore
* Require
  * Order

(All the libraries can be found in 'js/lib/')

Index.html loads all the nessecary libraries to start the
application. It also contains templates used by Underscore
throughout the whole application.

Upd
1. Add funtionality to remove a user and clear all the data.
   ie. a "destory"-button on the right-upper corner.

2. Add functionality for multi-user. Atm the application is
   restricted to only one user per browser.

3. Add functionality to add more categories. Atm the category
   view appends new categories to the right.

4. "Drag & drop" between categories.

5. Doubleclick on a task to edit.

6. In some way, clear all completed tasks.
